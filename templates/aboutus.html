        <h2>About Our Project</h2>
        <p>
          Our project, <strong>Plant Disease Detection System</strong>, is an AI-powered solution designed to identify plant leaf diseases with exceptional accuracy. Leveraging deep learning techniques and a large annotated dataset, our model achieved a remarkable <strong>training accuracy of 99.32%</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The main goal of our system is to assist farmers and agriculturists by providing quick, reliable, and automated diagnosis of plant diseases, reducing crop loss and supporting sustainable agriculture.
        </p>
        <p>
          This project was developed as a part of our academic initiative. It was mentored by <strong>Dr. Snehlata</strong>, whose expert guidance was instrumental throughout the development. Our team includes dedicated members: <strong>Aditya Yadav</strong> (Project Lead & ML Developer) and <strong>Adnan Riyaz</strong> (Research & Deployment).
        </p>
        <p>
          We combined state-of-the-art transfer learning models, data preprocessing techniques, and intuitive UI to ensure both high performance and usability. The system is also integrated with web and mobile platforms for easy access.

          <h2>Our Vision & Innovation</h2>
          <p>
            The Plant Disease Detection System uses advanced deep learning to identify crop leaf diseases with exceptional precision. Designed to assist farmers and agricultural experts, our solution provides real-time insights using just an image of the infected leaf.
          </p>
          <p>
            By harnessing the power of transfer learning and a robust image dataset, we achieved a model training accuracy of <strong>99.32%</strong>. This ensures reliable predictions, making it a practical tool for field use and academic research alike.
